# Crystalnite

This was my ICS2O Final Project, and it took 2 months to develop. It's a 2D RPG (Role-Playing Game) similar to Undertale where you control a character, fight mobs, and obtain the crystal at the end. This project contains most of the concepts taught in ICS2O, including variables, if-else statements, loops, functions, GUI, and some extra stuff that you don't learn.
