# Crystalnite

This was my ICS2O Final Project, and it took 2 months to develop. It's a 2D RPG (Role-Playing Game) similar to Undertale where you control a character, fight mobs, and obtain the crystal at the end. This project contains most of the concepts taught in ICS2O, including variables, if-else statements, loops, functions, GUI, and some extra stuff that you don't learn. I worked in a group with 2 other students to get the project done, and I was responsible for the attack GUI and graphic creating.

# Notes
 - Special thanks to Darren for working on the character and map mechanics, and Sanjay for the inventory. We stuck together and worked on this difficult project over the course of 2 months.
 - This is an incomplete version because Darren refused to give me the finished version for some strange reason. He kept trolling me by sending other random files ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 - We decided on the name of this game by using a random video game name generator (no affiliation with Fortnite)
 - Don't use Youtube to MP3 websites on school Wi-Fi. Most of them are blocked and if you do manage to find one, conversion is very slow (as we learned the hard way).
 - Necromancer go brrrr
